[Hey [Customer], 
Thanks for reaching out! I'd be more than happy to help you. This is our guide to Troubleshooting your Deployment https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/#health-checks-failing
Before we dive in, can you give me a little more context on the situation? What was the small change that you made? Could you send your config/runtime.exs and fly.toml? To see the specific VM status, run fly status --all to get a list of VMs. Find one with status failed , then run fly vm status <id> . This will give you a lot more information.
These questions will help me find a more personalized solution to your problem.

Thank you,
Jose Pereiro.
Support Engineer.
